# GoogleMapWithPolylinesUsingJAVA

This project involves incorporating Google Maps into an Android app, including markers and polylines. The project is divided into three parts, with the first part requiring the creation of an activity and following the Google Maps documentation. The second part involves using the OkHTTP library to retrieve path information from an API and parsing the retrieved data. The final part requires plotting the trip points on the map using a Polyline shape, indicating the start and end points of the trip with markers, and centering and zooming the map to display all the trip points. The map should also be auto-zoomed to include all the trip points in the mapâ€™s bounding box.
